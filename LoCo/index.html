            What is a LoCo?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Ever since the birth of computers, enthusiasts and fans around the world have collected together in garages, universities and pubs to talk about their interest, learn from each other and help promote their interest.
            Combine this with the huge popularity of Ubuntu, and you have the Ubuntu LoCo project.
            LoCo stands for <b>Lo</b>cal <b>Co</b>mmunity Team.
            With the incredible success of Ubuntu around the world, the LoCo project is here to help groups of Ubuntu fans and enthusiasts work together in regional teams to help advocate, promote, translate, develop and otherwise improve Ubuntu.

        <h3>
            So Wisconsin has a LoCo?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Yes it does!
            The Ubuntu US Wisconsin Local Community Team advocates the use of Open Source software and Ubuntu in the State of Wisconsin, USA.
            This is done through CD distribution, team expansion, user-base support, and outreach programs.
            If you would like to learn more about our LoCo, and to keep up-to-date with what is going on, please see our wiki page <a style="color: blue;" href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WisconsinTeam">here</a>.
        </p>
        <h3>
            For some reason, it seems that the LoCo isn't verified...what is going on with that?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Our goal is to get verified soon, so do not worry.
            Keep updated with our various resources to know when this happens.
