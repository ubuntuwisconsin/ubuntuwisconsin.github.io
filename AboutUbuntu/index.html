        <h3>Ubuntu itself</h3>
        <p>
            Ubuntu is an <a style="color: blue;" href="https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source">open source</a> alternative to major platforms such as Windows or Mac OS X.
            ‘Ubuntu’ is an African word meaning ‘humanity to others’. It also means ‘I am what I am because of who we all are’, which aptly describes the open source and open community nature of the project.
            Ubuntu is the most popular <a style="color: blue;" href="http://goo.gl/4nmQi8">Linux distribution</a> there is, with millions of users worldwide.
            The project is backed by a company named <a style="color: blue;" href="http://www.canonical.com/about">Canonical</a>, which sponsors the project and provides several useful services for it.
            Some fast facts about Ubuntu are <a style="color: blue;" href="https://insights.ubuntu.com/about/">here</a>, if you would like to know more about the project itself.

        <h3>How often do I have to update?</h3>
        <p>
            First and formost, you should frequently update your Ubuntu computer because every update fixes a lot of bugs, adds new features, and chances are, will make your computer run better.
            <br /><br />
            Ubuntu has 2 release channels.
            <b>Stable</b> and <b>Long Term Support(LTS)</b>.
            <br /><br />
            A new <b>LTS</b> release is released every <b>2 years</b>, and it is oriented towards stability.
            LTS releases are supported for <b>5 years</b> after release.
            During the release cycle, it allows for much less time to add features, and focuses on bug fixing to make it as stable as possible.
            <br /><br />
            A new <b>stable</b> release is released every <b>6</b> months and is oriented towards more features.
            During the release cycle, it allows for more time for developers to add new featues, and less time to fix bugs compared to an LTS release.
            Stable releases are supported for <b>9 months</b> after release.
